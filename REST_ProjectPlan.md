# Team REST
# Date of update: 2017-10-30

## Background
Lillebaelt Academy University of Applied Science has agreed with one of representative of Juniper Networks on a project to create an automated system. The 3rd semester students will make the project.
## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to develop a system that allows users from any computer with internet access to use the physical networking laboratory facilities at Juniper Networks Lab in Amsterdam. The REST team will create a flask application that receives QFX parameters and then send those as a dictionary, to the PyEZ team.
## Goals
The team sets the following goals:
* Create a project plan
* Create a HLD
* Implementation
* Testing
* Documentation
* Meetings with the PyEZ team

## Organization
The project is worked on by different teams formed from the class and the lecturing team as project managers.
## Budget and resources
* Budget: None as the tools we will be using are free
* Resources: The students in team REST

## Risk Assessment
* Time: This project has a deadline and we have approximately 8 days overall. REST team must work productively
* Skills: The team has not worked with RESTful API before and might run into problems. It is important for the team to know what the outcome of their application will look like so they can work toward it.
* Communication: This project is dependent on all the teams participating in this project. Having miscommunication might have a negative impact on the overall goal.
